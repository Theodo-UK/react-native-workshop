# React Native Deployment workshop

Deploying a React Native app to a staging platform quicker than...

## Start here

`git clone git@github.com:Theodo-UK/react-native-workshop.git`
(or `git clone https://github.com/Theodo-UK/react-native-workshop.git`)

## Before we start

### What you should have done

- [ ] Node > `6` installed
- [ ] Ruby > `2.2.3` (and < `2.4`*)
- [ ] Bundler installed (`gem install bundler`)
- [ ] Yeoman installed (`npm i -g yo`)
- [ ] Yarn installed (`npm i -g yarn`)
- [ ] react-native-cli installed (`npm i -g react-native-cli`)
- [ ] The RN-Toolbox Yeoman generator installed (`npm install -g yo generator-rn-toolbox`)
- [ ] Created an account for your company (or you as a single developer) on [HockeyApp](https://hockeyapp.net/)
- [Â ] Register your iPhone by logging in on https://hockeyapp.net/ (if you have an iPhone)

### What we did for you <3

These are steps already taken to setup a basic app that we can use to test the deployment tools.

- [x] `react-native init deploymentWorkshop`
- [x] Changed the text and added an amazing image to `index.ios.js` and `index.android.js`

## Setting up locally

```
cd deploymentWorkshop
yarn
```

And check that your setup is working correctly: `react-native run-ios`

## Setting up for deployment

### Setup Fastlane for this project

`yo rn-toolbox:fastlane-setup`

- Choose a project name
- Confirm to commit the keystore file
- Say yes to all conflicts (we haven't changed anything else yet so we can safely override any conflicts)

`yo rn-toolbox:fastlane-env`

- Confirm your project name
- Set `staging` as the name of the first environment we will configure. This environment will be used to test your features as they are developed
- At Theodo we use the convention `{NameOfMyApp} S` for the staging environment
- Choose `HockeyApp` as the platform. This is the one we'll show you how to use in this workshop.
- When asked which type of certificate you want to use, chose `In House` if you have an Apple Enterprise account, AdHoc otherwise. (TODO: Explain the difference between the two types of certificate?)
- Create a repository called `certificates` in your entreprise Github account or in your own private account. Make sure all your team members have READ access to this git repository.

- When asked for the TeamID, provide ....
- Set your Apple ID with the email you use for your Apple Developer Account
- Confirm the given keystore password and save it somewhere (or specify your own)
- In your HockeyApp account, go to "Account Settings > API TOKENS" and create a new token to READ and WRITE all your apps. Call it "All apps"
- Copy the token and paste it when the generator asks for a valid HockeyApp token


### Generate the provisioning profiles for iOS

```
bundle exec fastlane ios setup --env=<myenv>
```


### Deploy the iOS version

Run `npm run deploy:staging:ios` and wait for the magic to happen.

- You should see the app created in your HockeyApp account
- You should see your `certificates` Git repository updated.

### Deploy the Android version

Run `npm run deploy:staging:android` and wait for the magic to happen

- You should see the Android app created in your HockeyApp account

### BONUS: Update the app icon

We're going to use the generator again. First, you need a `192x192` image (we provided you with a very nice one but you're free to use your own).

You also need to install `imagemagick`

```
brew install imagemagick
```

And then

```
yo rn-toolbox:assets --icon theodo-rn-appicon.png
```

Finally, the change will only apply to Android if we bump the version, so you need to update the version in the `android/app/build.gradle` to `1.1.0`

Now you can deploy this new version with the icon to Hockeyapp:

```
npm run deploy:staging:ios && npm run deploy:staging:android
```
